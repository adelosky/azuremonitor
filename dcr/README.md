Data collection rules (DCRs) are part of an Extract, transform, and load (ETL)-like data collection process that improves on legacy data collection methods for Azure Monitor. This process uses a common data ingestion strategy for all data sources and a standard method of configuration that's more manageable and scalable than previous collection methods.

Specific advantages of DCR-based data collection include:

Consistent method for configuration of different data sources.
Ability to apply a transformation to filter or modify incoming data before it's sent to a destination.
Scalable configuration options supporting infrastructure as code and DevOps processes.
Option of Azure Monitor pipeline in your own environment to provide high-end scalability, layered network configurations, and periodic connectivity.
