# Data collection rules (DCRs) in Azure Monitor

Data collection rules (DCRs) are part of an [Extract, transform, and load (ETL)](/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/etl)-like data collection process that improves on legacy data collection methods for Azure Monitor. This process uses a common data ingestion strategy for all data sources and a standard method of configuration that's more manageable and scalable than previous collection methods.

For many monitoring scenarios, you don't need to understand how a DCR is created or assigned. You can simply use guidance in the Azure portal to enable and configure data collection, while Azure Monitor creates and configures the DCR for you. This article provides more details about how DCRs work to get you started on creating and configuring them manually so that you can customize the data collection process.

Specific advantages of DCR-based data collection include:

* Consistent method for configuration of different data sources.
* Ability to apply a transformation to filter or modify incoming data before it's sent to a destination.
* Scalable configuration options supporting infrastructure as code and DevOps processes.
* Option of Azure Monitor pipeline in your own environment to provide high-end scalability, layered network configurations, and periodic connectivity.
